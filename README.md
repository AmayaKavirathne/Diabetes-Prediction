# Diabetes_Prediction_Model

This repository contains a Python script for building a neural network-based model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The code utilizes the TensorFlow and scikit-learn libraries for building and evaluating the model. The dataset is preprocessed, oversampled to handle class imbalance, and then fed into a neural network for training and evaluation.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
TensorFlow

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv). It contains the following features:

Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
The target variable is 'Outcome,' indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.
